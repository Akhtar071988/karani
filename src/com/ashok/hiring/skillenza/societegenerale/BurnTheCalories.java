/**
 * Problem Name: Burn the calories
 * Link: https://skillenza.com/challenge/societegenerale-code-a-thon-javafullstack-mar/checkpoint/submit/1242
 * <p>
 * Zack is suffering from obesity and his doctor has advised him to go for running every day. However, he only has n days on which he can go for running.
 * The number of calories burned on the kth day is given by 2 * i + d, where i is the miles he has already covered on the previous (k-1)th
 * days and d is the number of miles he ran on the kth day.
 * <p>
 * You are given a collection of not necessarily distinct non-negative integers d1, d2, â€¦, dn.
 * On any given day where he goes for a run, he runs exactly di kilometers where di belongs to this collection of numbers.
 * In other words, a number from this collection represents the allowed number of kilometers he can run on any given day.
 * <p>
 * At the end of n days, he has used up every number from this collection. That is, all allowed daily values have been used.
 * For complete implementation please see
 * {@link https://github.com/AshokRajpurohit/karani/tree/master/src/com/ashok/}
