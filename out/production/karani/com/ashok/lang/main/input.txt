Question #1 of 1
You wrote a big code, but instead of using '+' operator, you used '*' operator everywhere. Now, you need to write the code to replace + by *, wherever you find it in code.
Note : The replacement is to be done only in code, and not in comments. A comment is a string that starts with "//" and terminates at the end of the line.
Expected Input : 1 line of code. 
Expected Output
Print code with the new version.
Sample Input
t+a=0 //t+a does something
Expected Output
t*a=0 //t+a does something
Other test cases:
Input :
t+a+b/c+d = o //t+a+b/c+d = o
Output :
t*a*b/c*d = o //t+a+b/c+d = o
